## X / Twitter Posts

1. Platform engineering isn’t about dashboards. It’s about removing human bottlenecks. Automation > portals.
2. YAML doesn’t scale teams. Automation does.
3. Dev experience doesn’t end at git push. Deploy, operate, monitor — automate it all.
4. Consulting can’t scale platform operations. Software can.
5. The future of DevOps is less configuration, more intent.

Clode automates the later stages of the SDLC so teams ship faster without burning engineers on ops toil.
